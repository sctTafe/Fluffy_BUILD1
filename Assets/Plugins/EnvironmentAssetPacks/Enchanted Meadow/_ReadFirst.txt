Thanks for purchasing TOON Enchanted Meadow!
Glad to have you as a customer.

A few easy steps are required in order to ensure proper function of the pack.

	1. Please make sure you install the proper version in your Unity Project. At the moment, only Built-in (2022.3.0 and later) and URP (2022.3.0 and later) are supported.

	2.	Make sure to check the "Opaque Texture" option box in the "Universal Render Pipeline Asset" that you're using in your project.
You can find it in the "Assets > Settings" folder.

		Enable "Realtime Reflection Probes" in the Quality section of the Project Settings. (Edit > Project Settings)

		This is required for the water shader to function with full features.
